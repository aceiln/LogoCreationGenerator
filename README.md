# Logo Automatic Generator
## Description
The project revolves around using node and OOP to generate a logo using user promps. The motivation of this project was to better understand how to use user prompts and incorporate them using OOP skills we developed over the week. The problem that it solves allows us to randomly generate an image using four simple prompts and a simple render. I was able to learn how to associate and tie both OOP and Node together, generate an image using the combination, and explore into other additions into this project.
